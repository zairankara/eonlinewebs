"Nonce, Please!" is a simple plugin that prevents brute-force comments and trackbacks from spammer. This is *NOT* an alternatives to Akismet.

== Description ==

Akismet is a great plugin to block spam comments/trackbacks. It detects spams completely. But, Akismet allows to accept unsolicited feedbacks, and to store them in the database. It is weaker act to fight with spams. A better way is to reject them.

Also, the architecture of WordPress is vulnerable for spammer. Because the comment API is fixed URL like: "wp-comments-post.php", "wp-trackback.php, or "http://blog.example.com/archives/99/trackback/". Therefore, spammers can easily post bulk comments/trackbacks to WordPress weblogs.

"Nonce, Please!" add a nonce (random strings) to the comment hidden field and/or the trackback URL. A valid comment and/or trackback should have a nonce string. Bulk feedbacks will not have nonce.
This plugins also verifies that a new comment/trackbacks has the valid nonce. If there is no nonce or an invalid one, the feedback is rejected.

Adding and verifying nonce is automatic, users are not do anything!

== Screenshots ==

1. A random string (nonce) is added to the trackback URI.

== Requirements ==

* WordPress 2.3 or later
* PHP 4.2 or later

== Installation ==

1. Unzip a zip archive and put only the nonce_please.php file into your plugins directory (may be `wp-content/plugins`) of the server.
1. Activate the plugin.

== License ==

The license of this plugin is GPL v2.

== Restrictions ==

* If you are using cacheing plugins (such as WP-Cache, WP Suer Cache), make sure that caching time less than 12 hours. Because WordPress nonce string will change in 12 hours cycle and valid for 24 hours. If caching longer than 12 hours, invalid nonce will be survived at your site.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Will Akismet no use when I use "Nonce, Please!"?

A: No. This plugin detect only bulk feedbacks that are sent to hard-coded comment/trackback URLs as "http://blog.example.com/wp-trackback.php?p=NNN." I suggest keep using Akismet. You will see fewer spams at Akismet admin panel!
