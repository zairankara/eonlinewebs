Provides a method of turning the WordPress heartbeat off as well as change some settings.

== Description ==

Provides a method of turning the WordPress heartbeat off as well as change some settings. We use this plugin at RD because the heartbeat was clobbering site performance when more than one editor was logged into the CMS. In the future I plan to add the ability to adjust the settings.

+ Disables admin-ajax.php except on the posts, post edit & quick edit pages
+ Disables hearbeat autostart
+ Sets the heartbeat interval to 60 seconds

== Installation ==

1. Upload `ajax-heartbeat-tool` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The get_called_class() kind requires PHP5.3 or newer
   (http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-called-class.php)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a setting or options page? =

Currently no, but in the future I plan to add the ability to adjust the settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. Since there's no settings page there is nothing to see here... yet. 

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Added 'Quick edit exclusion'
* Corrected misleading constants

= 1.0 =
* Initial stable version.

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above.  This may be of use for extremely 
complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation."  Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
